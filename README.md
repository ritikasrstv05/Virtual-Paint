# Virtual-Paint<br>
This is a model in which OpenCv is used to built a Virtual Paint.This enables us to draw and paint on air which will act as our canvas.<br>

  This is implemented with help of various techniques .Some techniques used are:
  - Color Detection
  - Shape detection
  - Counter detection
<br>
  
  Here are a snap from my model:<br>

- I included data for three colors.
- All three colors can be painted simuntaneously.
- we can also insert more colours if we want.
- Let's take a look.
