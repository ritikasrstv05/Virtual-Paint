# Virtual-Paint<br>
This is a model in which OpenCv is used to built a Virtual Paint.This enables us to draw and paint on air which will act as our canvas.<br>
<p>
  This is implemented with help of various techniques .Some techniques used are:
  - Color Detection
  - Shape detection
  - Counter detection
